"""The epistemic/pragmatic crossover statistic over an EFE horizon.

The per-step epistemic value is fixed by the one-step EFE, but its aggregation over a
horizon is not — this module fixes it. The crossover contrasts two policies, a *walk*
(detour to sense, then exploit) and a *reach* (head for the goal), by the difference in
their summed EFE components:

    Δε(H) = Σ_k [ε_k(walk) − ε_k(reach)]      the accumulated epistemic pull
    Δc(H) = Σ_k [c_k(walk) − c_k(reach)]      the accumulated pragmatic gradient
    ΔG(H) = Δc(H) − Δε(H) = G(walk) − G(reach)

Both sides contrast the *same* two policies, summed over the horizon. That symmetry is
what the H=1 anchors force. ``ΔG(H) < 0`` is the crossover, and because ΔG is the
difference in the minimised objective, its sign flip is the argmin flip.
``H* = min{H : ΔG(H) < 0}``.

The statistic is defined before the sweep measures H* (see warrant_numbers.md and
``tests/test_crossover.py``). This module gives the statistic and the H* definition;
the H-sweep harness does the measuring.
