"""Checkable conditions on a model's sensor, over the states an action can reach.

Whether a state-dependent ``R(x)`` actually buys an agent anything is not a property of
the noise function alone — it depends on where the control can put the predicted mean.
A noise that varies only in a corner no policy reaches is, for every purpose the filter
and the objective have, a constant. The conditions here are the ones that separate the
two cases, and each is reported against a *sampled reachable set*: the predicted means
of a set of candidate actions from a shared belief.

Four conditions, in the order they bite:

``full_row_rank``
    ``C`` carries no redundant channels, so ``C Cᵀ`` is invertible. Matching a
    posterior covariance then identifies the noise uniquely; without it, only the
    noise's action on the row space of ``C`` is identified, and covariances off that
    subspace are free.

``definite``
    ``R(x) ≻ 0`` at every sampled mean. The epistemic term inverts ``R`` and takes its
    log-determinant, so anywhere this fails the term is not defined — the kernel returns
    NaN there rather than a plausible-looking number.

``non_constant``
    ``R`` takes different values across the sampled means. This is what makes the
    posterior covariance, and so the Kalman gain, depend on the action.

``epistemic_varies``
    The per-step epistemic value differs across those means. Stronger than
    ``non_constant``: the epistemic term is a log-determinant, a single scalar summary,
    and a covariance can move along a contour of it without the scalar noticing. For a
    scalar observation the two coincide, since the map is then strictly monotone in the
    variance. ``loewner_comparable`` reports the cheap sufficient condition — noise
    covariances ordered by ``≺`` always separate the determinant.

Sampling is what it is: these answer "over the actions I asked about", not "over every
reachable state". A negative is evidence, not proof.
