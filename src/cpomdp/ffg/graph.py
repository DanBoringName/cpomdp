"""A tree of Gaussian-coupled variables and the structure that wires it together.

Nodes are integer indices ``0..N-1``, each with a dimension. A ``Coupling`` edge links
a parent node to a child node through a linear-Gaussian factor and a time-constant, and
the edges must form a tree rooted at a chosen node. ``CouplingGraph`` gathers the
nodes, edges, and per-node observations and checks, on construction, that the wiring is
a well-formed rooted tree with dimension-consistent factors.

The graph carries no names: a node is only its index, so the same structure can stand
for any model. It holds structure, not inference — building one validates the wiring;
the message passing that reads it lives elsewhere.
