"""Backends that filter worse than the model they are built for, and say how.

Each wraps or replaces the exact filter for one model and keeps ``model`` pointing at
that same model, so a caller reading ``backend.model`` still gets the model the results
are scored under. ``degradation`` names what the filter does differently.

``WrongFixedRBackend`` plugs a fixed observation noise into the filter, scaled away from
the one the model declares. ``DiagonalCovarianceBackend`` drops the covariance's
off-diagonal terms after every step, so the correlation never reaches the next gain.
