    The carry drops the cross-cluster covariance that edge holds across the time
    boundary (the ADR-016 severed mass). That cross-temporal correlation is how
    information about a slow latent integrates from weak per-step observations of the
    fast nodes it couples to; severing an edge on the covariance path from the sensed
    nodes to the targeted latent breaks that integration. The one-step epistemic and the
    behavioural drift can still look right while the *accumulated* information about the
    latent — what the instrumental epistemic rides on — degrades, up to collapse for an
    integration-limited latent. Whether the degradation is mild or total is
    model-specific (measure it with the severed-mass diagnostic ``partition_error``), so
    the guard refuses conservatively rather than sever and hope. Keep the flagged edge's
    endpoints in one cluster, or, if a check shows the cut is safe, drop its
    ``efe_relevant`` flag.

    recursive filter step: the current belief goes in as the ``prior`` and the
    updated belief comes back as the posterior.

    The Protocol is structural: any class with a matching ``infer_states`` (and the
    ``model`` it was built from) is a backend, with no shared base class. This is the
    abstraction wall — the native Kalman fast path and the RxInfer oracle are
    interchangeable behind it, and neither's implementation (JAX, juliacall, …) leaks
    into this signature.

    ``LinearGaussianModel`` validates the model once at construction; this gives

    path and the RxInfer oracle validating *identically* — an oracle that
