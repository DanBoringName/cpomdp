"""Exhaustive EFE search over a declared finite action set (ADR-030, ADR-031).

The enumerated counterpart of ``EFESelector``'s continuous grid, and a deliberately
*different object* so the two cannot be confused. ``EFESelector`` samples a continuous
action box and tiles each sample into a **constant-action** policy — a sample of a
continuum, warrant ``CORROBORATED`` (Prover 3a: corroborates, never decides).
``EnumeratedEfeSearch`` enumerates **every** length-H sequence of a finite, declared,
versioned ``FiniteActionSet`` — all ``|A|^H`` of them, *varying* sequences included — so
"no policy in this set flips" is **decided**, not sampled: warrant ``PROVED`` (Prover
3b). A ``CompletenessCertificate`` records ``expected = |A|^H`` against the ``visited``
count and asserts they match (ADR-030), so the decisive warrant is earned, not assumed.

The set is versioned because it is a modelling commitment: an action added after results
are seen must show up in the diff, not be discovered by a reviewer. The ``PROVED``
warrant is scoped to the *declared* set — whether that set is fine enough is a separate
question a refinement-stability check answers, not this certificate.
