"""One-step Expected Free Energy (EFE) for the linear-Gaussian regime.

This module computes ``G(a)`` — the Expected Free Energy of taking action ``a``
from the current belief — and its decomposition into a *pragmatic* (goal-seeking)
and an *epistemic* (information-seeking) part. Minimising ``G`` over actions is
how an agent chooses what to do.

================================================================================
THE DECISION THIS FILE ENCODES  (see DECISIONS.md ADR-005)
================================================================================
There is *no single agreed formula* for EFE in the active-inference literature —
the pragmatic term in particular has at least three forms in circulation, and
sources disagree on signs and on whether risk is a cross-entropy or a KL. One
route is chosen here deliberately, and the two questions that most affect what
the objective *does* are settled rather than assumed: the cross-entropy and
KL-risk groupings are the same objective (the derivation is below, and both forms
are reproduced by the tests), and the sign convention follows from that. What
stays genuinely open is flagged ``# FRAGILE(lit):`` — the preference domain, and
the fork between the full pragmatic term and a mean-only one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LOCKED DEFINITION  (decomposition (b): cross-entropy − info-gain)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given belief ``(μ, Σ)``, action ``a``, model ``(A, B, Q)`` with sensor ``(C, R)``,
and an OBSERVATION-space preference ``(g, Λ)`` (goal observation ``g``, precision
``Λ``):

    predict:    μ⁺ = A·μ + B·a            Σ⁺ = A·Σ·Aᵀ + Q
    sense:      (C, R) = observation.linearize(μ⁺)
                o⁺ = C·μ⁺                  S = C·Σ⁺·Cᵀ + R          # predicted-obs cov
    pragmatic:  ½·(o⁺ − g)ᵀ·Λ·(o⁺ − g)  +  ½·tr(Λ·S)
    epistemic:  ½·(ln det S − ln det R)            # = I(state; obs) ≥ 0, info gain
    G = pragmatic − epistemic                      # minimise: low cost, high info

``S`` is computed once and feeds BOTH terms — there is no n×n work and no Σ_post
or Kalman gain in the one-step EFE (those are only needed for belief propagation
in the H-step rollout, ``policy_efe``). The epistemic identity
``½(ln det Σ⁺ − ln det Σ_post) = ½ ln(det S / det R)`` lets us stay in m×m.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FRAGILE CHOICES  (grep: ``FRAGILE(lit)``)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Preference domain = OBSERVATIONS, not states. Canonical pymdp/Friston puts
   preferences over outcomes, so this is the faithful choice — but it diverges
   from ADR-003's collapse argument, which is written in state space, and it does
   NOT match the state-space ``goal`` the LQR path currently uses. Reconciling the
   two consumers of ``Preference`` (state-space LQR vs obs-space EFE) is an OPEN
   design point; for C = I (fully observed) they coincide.
2. Pragmatic = FULL form (mean + ½tr(ΛS)), i.e. cross-entropy −E_Q[ln P(o)] up to a
   fixed constant. Cross-entropy paired with −info-gain (as here) and KL-risk
   paired with +ambiguity are the SAME objective — not a behavioural fork; the two
   groupings differ by a constant, and each carries one half of the same entropy
   gap. The genuine literature fork is FULL vs *mean-only* (drop the ½tr(ΛS) term →
   an agent blind to predicted-observation variance/ambiguity). The *forbidden mix*
   (KL-risk pragmatic − info-gain) double-counts H[Q(o)]: a bug, not an option.
3. Epistemic = STATE information gain (salience), not parameter information gain
   (novelty). Only the state info-gain I(state; obs) is computed; parameter/novelty
   EFE is out of scope.
4. The sensor is linearized at μ⁺ (the predicted mean). A fixed sensor is its own
   linearization everywhere, so the point is immaterial there — but for a
   state-dependent ``R(x)`` it is the modelling commitment the whole epistemic term
   rests on: the action moves μ⁺, μ⁺ chooses R, and R sets the information. It is a
   first-order rule, and a plug-in one: it drops the correction for R's curvature
   across the belief's spread.
5. Sign convention: G is MINIMISED; ``pragmatic`` is a cost (lower better) and
   ``epistemic`` is a value (higher better), so G = pragmatic − epistemic.

NOT IMPLEMENTED (named seams): the *mean-only* pragmatic (drops ½tr(ΛS); the real
literature alternative — an ambiguity-blind agent); parameter/novelty info gain.
The KL-risk grouping is NOT a separate option: paired correctly (+ambiguity) it is
this same G; paired with −info-gain it double-counts H[Q(o)] (a bug to avoid).

    A ``NamedTuple`` because it is a JAX pytree with no registration: ``lax.scan`` emits
    it directly as its ``ys`` (stacking each field along the leading H axis) and it
    survives ``jit`` / ``vmap`` / ``grad``, gaining any outer ``vmap`` axis too. That is
    the difference from ``_EfeStep``, which is a plain dataclass precisely because it
    never crosses a scan/transform boundary.

    The FFG counterpart of ``_efe_step`` (issue #26). It takes the predicted joint
    moments directly — ``μ⁺``/``Σ⁺`` from ``CouplingGraphBackend.predicted_belief``,
    which already fold in the structural couplings — rather than recomputing
    ``Σ⁺ = A·Σ·Aᵀ + Q`` from a flat model (that route mistakes the couplings for
    observations). The ``pragmatic`` term is identical to ``_efe_step``
    (observation-space cross-entropy); the ``epistemic`` term is the only change — info
    gain about the marginal at ``info_block`` (``_state_info_gain``) instead of the
    whole-state observation-space determinant.

    With no couplings and ``info_block`` the whole state, this reproduces
    ``_efe_step`` /
    ``expected_free_energy`` exactly; a node's block targets the epistemic at that
    latent — the factored analogue of the T-Maze cue (ADR-014 finding #3). Pure
    ``jnp``, so it rides ``jit``/``vmap`` over a grid of candidate actions (which vary
    ``μ⁺``, while ``Σ⁺`` at this one step does not see the action (ADR-003)). What the
    action does reach is ``R`` at ``μ⁺``, and through it the posterior.

    Args:
        mu_plus: μ⁺, the predicted joint mean under the candidate action (n-D).
        sigma_plus: Σ⁺, the predicted joint covariance (n x n) — couplings included.
