"""Process-noise models: state-dependent dynamics noise Q(x).

The internal-noise dual of ``observation``. ``DynamicsNoise`` is the seam the EFE
predict step asks for the process-noise covariance at a state; ``CallableProcessNoise``
is the state-dependent case. Per RFC-001 chapter 8 this is where the *binding* precision
constraint lives for the chemotaxis fidelity (internal processing, not the sensor).
The kernel evaluates it at ``μ⁺`` — the diffusion of the arrived-at state.
