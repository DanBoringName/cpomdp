"""The world and the agent as separate objects, with no reference between them.

``World`` runs the process that produces observations. ``ScoredAgent`` runs the model
it filters with. Neither holds the other: ``World`` has no accessor returning its model
or any parameter of it, and ``ScoredAgent`` has no constructor slot for a ``World``.
Nothing here carries a reference from either one to the other.

Actions arrive from outside. ``driven_step`` takes the action to predict with, so one
sequence can drive several agents. There is no selector here and no ``sample_action``.

``drive`` runs one world and any number of agents over an
``ExogenousActionSequence``: the world advances once per step, and every agent folds
the same reading. What comes back is a ``DrivenRun``, which carries the declaration
that the control loop was cut alongside the trajectories, so no number leaves here
without it.
