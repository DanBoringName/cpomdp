"""Scoring a declared cross of models against a declared cross of ways to infer.

The two axes live in ``cpomdp.constructors``: one for what a model gets
wrong about the process, one for what its filter gets wrong about the model. A run
crosses them. Every separation reported from such a run is a comparison between two of
its cells, which is a decision only if the cross was visited in full.

So the cross carries a certificate. `|model axis| x |inference axis|` is a product, and
a product needs its factors the way a policy tree needs its base and exponent: 12 is
``3 x 4`` and ``2 x 6``, so a bare count names neither which axes were crossed nor which
version of each was declared. `ProductCompletenessCertificate` carries both, which is
what makes two runs over different crosses tellable apart (standing prohibition 9).
