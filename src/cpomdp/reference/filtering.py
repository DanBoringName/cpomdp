"""Exact Bayesian filtering on a quadrature grid.

Bayes as it is actually written: move the belief forward through the dynamics, then
multiply by the likelihood and divide by what that integrates to. On a grid every
step is arithmetic over node values, and the normalising integral that has no closed
form in general is a weighted sum.

The intractability of exact Bayes is a statement about dimension. A tensor grid costs
``k^d`` nodes, which is hopeless by ``d = 10`` and free at ``d = 1``. This module is
an instrument rather than a deployable filter: it runs on a low-dimensional latent to
measure what a Gaussian filter gets wrong on the same model, and it is never on an
agent's per-cycle path.

The two steps do not cost the same. ``condition`` touches each node once. ``predict``
contracts over an ``N x N`` matrix of pairwise transition densities, so it is
quadratic in the node count and it is where the dimension limit actually bites: at
``N = 10⁴`` that matrix alone is 800 MB. The matrix is an argument rather than
something built inside the prediction, so a trajectory reusing one kernel builds it
once and the cost sits where a reader can see it. If it ever needs to stop being
materialised, the chunked enumerator's pattern applies — accumulate over blocks of
destination rows and keep residency at ``O(chunk · N)``.

One grid carries the whole trajectory. Predicting onto a second grid would be a
different object with a different truncation, and nothing here needs one.

    Exact up to the grid. The only error is the quadrature's, which is discretisation
    and truncation, both of which shrink under refinement. No step of this assumes
    the posterior has any particular shape, which is the difference from a Gaussian
    filter, whose error under a state-dependent ``R(x)`` is structural and shrinks
    under nothing.

    The result is normalised, since an unnormalised posterior fed back in as the next
    step's prior drifts out of floating-point range within a few steps. Nothing is
    lost by it: ``posterior.log_normaliser - prior.log_normaliser`` is the log of
    what the product integrated to, which is the log evidence ``log p(y)`` whenever
    the prior itself integrates to one.

    Args:
        prior: the belief before the observation, on the grid the posterior will use.
        likelihood: evaluated once at every node of ``prior.grid``.

    The integral is a contraction of the transition matrix against the belief and the

    contributes what it should.

    Unnormalised on purpose. Exact prediction moves mass without creating or
    destroying it, so whatever the result integrates to below one is the box being
    too small for the density after the dynamics have spread it. Normalising here
    would divide that signal away, and prediction is where it first appears, since
