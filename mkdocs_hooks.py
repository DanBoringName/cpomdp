"""mkdocs hooks: expand the single-source `--8<--` includes and repoint their links.

Four site pages are one-line includes of a file that lives outside `docs/`:
`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `examples/README.md` and `examples/ffg/README.md`.
Each is browsed on GitHub too, where the directory shape is the repository's,
not the site's. One relative string cannot serve both.

So the sources keep the links a reader of the repo expects, and this hook
repoints them on the way into a page:

| written in `examples/README.md` | rendered on the site                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `../docs/assets/x.gif`          | `assets/x.gif`, served by the site itself   |
| `ffg/README.md`                 | `examples-ffg.md`, the page that includes it |
| `bacillus_uncertain_food.py`    | a `blob/main` URL. Source is not published  |
| `../docs/assets/`               | a `tree/main` URL. A directory is not a page |
| `#a-heading`                    | untouched. Anchors already work in both     |

A relative link with no target in the repository logs a mkdocs warning, so
`mkdocs build --strict` fails on it. Reference definitions (`[label]: path`)
are repointed and checked alongside inline links. Fenced blocks and inline
code spans are skipped, indented or not.

**Known gap: a four-space indented code block is not recognised**, so a link
inside one is rewritten and dead-link checked as though it were prose. The gap
is deliberate. Any pattern that matches an indented code block also matches
four-space list continuation, and a list item holding a link is ordinary
markdown. Closing this would trade a build that aborts loudly for a link that
ships silently wrong. Use a fence.
