# Action selection & goals

What the agent wants, and how it picks an action. `StateGoal` and `ObservationGoal` are the goals you hand the `Agent` (the continuous-state answer to pymdp's `C`); `Preference` and `EFESelector` are the machinery underneath expected-free-energy selection.

`ActionSelector` is the protocol every selector satisfies. `LQRSelector` is the fixed-sensor path, where expected free energy provably reduces to LQR [@koudahl2021epistemics] (ADR-003). `FfgEfeSelector` is `EFESelector`'s peer for a branching backend.
