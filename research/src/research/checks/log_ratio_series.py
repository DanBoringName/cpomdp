"""Structural pins on the log-ratio series, before any coefficient is derived.

The inference gap is a cumulant difference. With `q` the agent's plug-in Gaussian and
`p(x|y)` the exact posterior::

    KL(q ‖ p(·|y))  =  log E_q[e^W]  −  E_q[W]

where `W` is the log-ratio of the true likelihood to the plug-in one::

    W(x, y)  =  log N(y; x, R(x))  −  log N(y; x, R̄),        R̄ = R(μ)

Everything the expansion of the gap in prior spread rests on is a property of `W`: that
it vanishes when the noise is flat, that it carries no zeroth-order term in spread, and
that its leading term averages away under `q`. This module pins those properties
symbolically, so the derivation of the quartic coefficient has fixed ground to stand on
rather than conventions recalled from memory.

The construction itself lives in ``series_kernel``, which owns `W`, its expansion and
the moment operator. This module owns the questions. ``gap_series`` owns the
coefficients.

**Nothing here computes a gap coefficient.** Not `c₂`, not `c₄`, not `c₆`. The line is
drawn at the first-order term in `σ` and its expectation, which is where the structure
lives and where the arithmetic does not.

Run it::

    uv run --no-sync python -m research.checks.log_ratio_series --check
    uv run --no-sync python -m research.checks.log_ratio_series

Symbolic throughout. No floats, no numerics, no functional form chosen for `R`: the
log-derivatives `l₁..l₄` stay free symbols and `R̄` stays symbolic and is never set to
one. A check that passes only at `R̄ = 1` is a check that has lost a variable.

Every identity reports `PROVED` at `EXACT`, carrying a
[`SymbolicReduction`][cpomdp.SymbolicReduction] that names where the symbolic setup was
hand derived against the analytic problem. A CAS establishes that one expression equals
another and cannot establish that those are the expressions the claim is about, which is
the condition the warrant ledger attaches to Prover 2 being theorem-grade. A refuted
identity reports `FIRED` at `CORROBORATED`: simplification is incomplete, so a residual
the CAS could not reduce is evidence that something is wrong rather than proof of what.

Where this sits against the numeric checks. ``gap_kernel`` implements the same three
conventions in quadrature (reverse KL, `R` frozen at `R(μ)`, averaged under the true
predictive), and this module is where they are stated rather than coded. T6 and T8
together say the gap carries nothing at `σ⁰` or `σ¹`, so it starts at `σ²`.
``gap_expansion``'s G4a measures the residual after `c₂σ²` scaling as `σ⁴`. The symbolic
side supplies the reason, the numeric side the confirmation.

    this term, so asserting it is non-zero is asserting the two are not interchangeable.
