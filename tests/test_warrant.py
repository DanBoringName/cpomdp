"""The shared `Warrant` vocabulary and the check report that carries it.

`SearchWarrant` had two levels: `PROVED` (exhaustive enumeration) and `CORROBORATED`
(a grid sample). `Warrant` adds `CERTIFIED` (validated numerics over a compact domain)
and lives in `warrantlib`, where a check suite can reach it without cpomdp.
`SearchWarrant` stays as an alias, so existing call sites keep their members and their
return type.

`CheckReport` is what a registered falsifier emits: a warrant, an `Outcome`, a `Tier`,
and a reason. A falsifier does not pass, so `PASS` is not in the vocabulary at all. The
prover column disambiguates warrant, never the outcome. A check that never ran carries
no warrant, because attributing one claims evidence it did not produce.

The imports come through `cpomdp.warrant` rather than `warrantlib`, so the re-export
path a caller may already be using is exercised by every case below.
