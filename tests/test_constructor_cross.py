"""The cross of the two declared axes, and the certificate that it was enumerated.

Every separation Paper 2 reports is a comparison between two cells of one cross. What
makes that a decision rather than a survey is that the cross is finite, declared, and
visited in full. `|model axis| x |inference axis|` is a product, so the certificate
carries both axes and both versions: 12 is 3 x 4 and 2 x 6, and a bare count says which
neither.

The count is asserted rather than assumed. A cell dropped by a filter leaves a shorter
run in which every remaining cell still passes, and nothing but the count says so.
