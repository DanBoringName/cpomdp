"""The chunked enumerator — the same decision as the front-loaded path, in blocks.

`ChunkedEfeSearch` enumerates the same `A^H` set as `EnumeratedEfeSearch` and earns the
same `PROVED` warrant, but never materialises the policy set or the score vector. At
`17^7` a score vector alone would cost 3.28 GB, so the front-loaded path's ceiling is a
memory limit rather than a statement about the model, and this removes it.

What the locks below are for. Chunking is only admissible if it changes the residency
and nothing else, so the load-bearing assertion is not that the chunked path is
self-consistent — it is that it agrees with the path that produced the published
numbers, bit for bit.

- `TestCrossPathIdentity`: chunked against front-loaded on the same fixture, asserting
  equal `G` under `==` rather than `allclose`, equal argmin index, and an equal policy.
  This is what licenses re-reporting a published number from the new path.
- `TestChunkSizeInvariance`: the answer does not move with the block size, including
  blocks of one, blocks exactly `N`, and blocks larger than `N`.
- `TestTieBreak`: with a duplicated action set every minimum is a many-way tie, and
  both paths must return the *globally lowest* index. Order-invariance of `min` does
  not cover this, so it is asserted rather than argued.
- `TestCompleteness`: `visited` is a loop-carried count of unpadded lanes, not an
  array's length, so a padding bug shows here. Run at an `N` deliberately indivisible
  by the chunk.
- `TestReducerSeam`: an injected fold reproduces a NumPy count over the front-loaded
  score vector, which is how evidence beyond the argmin is obtained without a vector.
- `TestGuards`: the preconditions, including the index dtype's ceiling.
