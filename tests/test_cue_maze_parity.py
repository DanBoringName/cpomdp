"""`cue_maze.build_maze(1)` is the model the crossover was measured on, not a lookalike.

`cue_maze.py` is the dimension-agnostic rewrite of the corridor scene. Its comment
claims that at one spatial dimension it reproduces
`epistemic_dissociation_figure.build_backend(cue_x=CUE_DETOUR_X)` element for element.
The claim was true when it was written and nothing held it there: two model definitions
in two files, kept in sync by whoever remembered both.

That matters because the registered crossover number is measured on the dissociation
model. If the rewrite drifts, every result quoted off `cue_maze` silently stops being
about the model the number belongs to, and the coincidence of shapes hides it.

The frozen twins are excluded on purpose. They disagree, `cue_maze.py` says so and says
why, and pinning them equal here would assert the opposite.
