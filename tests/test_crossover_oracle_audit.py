"""Records what the crossover demo's NumPy oracle returns at H=7, before it changes.

`examples/ffg/crossover.py::_numpy_score` is the independent kernel the headline
`H* = 7` is checked against. Its per-step epistemic term calls `np.linalg.slogdet` and
keeps only the log-magnitude, so a covariance block with an even number of negative
eigenvalues returns a finite, plausible number instead of NaN. The shipped kernel does
not: `_efe_step` and `_state_info_gain` route through `_logdet_pd`, which tests positive
definiteness by Cholesky. The two routines were documented as differing, never audited.

Guarding the oracle is a precondition, not a change of arithmetic, so it must leave
every value here untouched. The anchors below make that checkable rather than asserted.
They are measured off the unguarded path and recorded first, so the guard cannot be
introduced and blessed in one step. An anchor carries no theory: it says the number did
not move, nothing about whether it was right to begin with.

`crossover.check()` gates the same numbers but enumerates ~150k policies and is marked
slow, so it is deselected on pull requests. Scoring two known policies costs a backend
build and fourteen propagation steps, which keeps the headline gated on every run.

`TestOracleRejectsNonPd` checks the route and not the guard: that the oracle reaches
`diagnostics.logdet_pd` for both halves of its epistemic term, and that the kernel
rejects the same matrix. `tests/test_diagnostics.py::TestLogdetPd` tests the guard.
