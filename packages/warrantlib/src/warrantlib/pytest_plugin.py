"""The warrant vocabulary in a pytest run, instead of a column of dots.

pytest has three outcomes and a check has five. Collapsing the five loses the two the
vocabulary exists to keep apart: a falsifier void by construction and one measured
elsewhere both read as a skip, and a run that survived everything without deciding
anything reads the same as one that decided it all.

So a check's outcome is carried alongside pytest's rather than replacing it.
`pytest_report_teststatus` sets the progress letter and the verbose word, which is how
`xfail` and `xpass` are spelled too, and the run's own accounting is printed at the end
in the vocabulary the checks reported in.

The pytest outcome underneath stays one of its three. `junitxml` branches on that and on
nothing else, so a fourth value writes the row as nothing at all and every CI parser
downstream sees a test that never ran.

Loaded through the ``pytest11`` entry point, so it is active wherever both packages are
installed. ``warrantlib`` itself imports nothing from here, and importing ``warrantlib``
does not import pytest.

#: question the run could not answer rather than one it answered in the claim's favour.
#: The two that never ran skip, because they did.
#:
#: The category is pytest's own rather than a new one, and this is the one place the
#: vocabulary gives ground. A category is what the closing tally counts under, so a
#: fresh one moves every check out of `N passed` into a name no existing tool reads:
#: `assert_outcomes` stops seeing them and `parseoutcomes` cannot split a two-word name.
#: The distinctions survive in the three places a reader meets them anyway. The letter
#: separates `v` from `e` and from `.` as the run goes, `-v` prints the check's own word
#: instead of `PASSED`, and the warrant summary carries the accounting that decides
#: anything. Buying a headline count with a broken tally is the wrong trade.
