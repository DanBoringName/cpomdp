"""Shared machinery for the example gallery.

Every demo in `examples/` tells its own story. They were all reaching for the same
handful of tools to tell it: the same colour-blind-safe palette, the same headless
matplotlib setup, the same figure-to-GIF loop, the same covariance ellipse, the same
expected-free-energy sweep. That was copied from script to script, so a fix in one never
reached the others. It lives here instead.

Nothing in this module is part of cpomdp's public API. It is presentation and plumbing.
It sits beside the demos rather than inside the library so that matplotlib and Pillow
stay out of the package. `conftest.py` puts `examples/` on the path, so the demos import
it by bare name.

Raid this file. The drawing helpers take an axis and leave the composition to you. The
EFE helpers are thin wrappers over the library kernel rather than reimplementations of
it.

Matplotlib and Pillow are imported lazily. The imports sit inside the functions that
need them, so a demo whose `check()` never renders anything still runs without the
`examples` extra.
