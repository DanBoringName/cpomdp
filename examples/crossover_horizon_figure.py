"""R(x) and a long enough H bring curiosity back to a linear-Gaussian agent.

Under a *fixed* linear-Gaussian sensor the epistemic term of expected free energy is a
constant across policies, so it cannot change any decision and the agent reduces to LQR
(the collapse `efe_collapse_figure.py` draws). A state-dependent `R(x)` breaks that: the
action reaches the noise, and curiosity becomes possible again. Possible is not the same
as decisive.

An open plane. The agent wants to be at a goal whose location it does not know. Its
prior points at `x*`. The goal is five units away from there. A beacon sits off the
straight line to `x*`, and standing near it makes the channel that reads the goal
sharp, so a detour is the only way to find out where the goal actually is. The detour
costs ground.

The animation runs the same world once per planning horizon. At a short horizon the
agent walks straight to the place it already believed in and settles there. It never
checks. Somewhere in the sweep it stops doing that and goes to the beacon first, finds
out it was wrong, and then goes to the real goal. Nothing changed but `H`: same model,
same prior, same sensor, same two candidate plans, same expected free energy.

**What the numbers on the figures are.** Expected free energy splits in two,
`G = c − ε`: a pragmatic cost `c`, how far the observations a plan expects sit from the
ones the agent prefers, and an epistemic value `ε`, how much it expects that plan to
teach it. Lower `G` is better, so a plan is worth taking when what it teaches outweighs
what it costs. Everything reported here is a *difference between the two candidate
plans*, detour minus direct:

    Δε = ε(detour) − ε(direct)      the extra information the detour buys
    Δc = c(detour) − c(direct)      the extra goal cost it pays for it
    ΔG = Δc − Δε = G(detour) − G(direct)

The difference is the whole decision. Whatever the two plans have in common cancels out
of it, so the absolute `G` of either one says nothing about which gets picked. All three
are in nats. `ΔG > 0` means the direct plan wins. `ΔG < 0` means the detour does. It is
positive at short horizons, negative at long ones, and crosses zero exactly once.

**What the planning horizon is.** `H` is how many steps of a plan the agent adds up when
it scores that plan. It is not how far it can see. The whole world is visible at every
`H`. What changes is how much of a plan's consequence is inside the window when the
agent commits to its next single step. At `H = 2` the detour cannot even reach the
beacon inside the window, so the information it would buy never appears on the balance
sheet at all. `Δε` there is under 0.01 nats.

**Why the horizon changes the answer.** The epistemic pull is *flat*. Once the horizon
is long enough to reach the beacon at all it sits at 6.67 nats and barely moves,
because sensing once is worth what sensing once is worth. What moves is the pragmatic
gradient. After the detour the sharpened goal belief lowers the expected cost of the
goal channel on *every remaining step*, and that saving accumulates until it covers the
one-off cost of walking off course. A constant pull outlasts a decaying gradient.
Nothing grows past anything.

**The control that makes it attributable.** A beacon-and-goal task on a plane looks like
the discrete cue tasks readers already know, so the whole sweep is re-run with `R` held
at a constant matched to the direct path, everything else identical. Curiosity then
never pays at any horizon in range. What freezing `R` zeroes is `Δε`, not `ε`. With a
fixed noise the covariance recursion never consults the action, so both plans carry the
identical covariance sequence, and whatever either one learns cancels out of the
difference. Each plan's own `ε` stays nonzero and grows with `H` (0.005 nats at `H = 2`,
0.042 at `H = 16`). The collapse ADR-003 records is action-invariance, not absence.
Both the state-dependent sensor and the horizon are load-bearing. Neither produces the
crossing alone.

Where the crossing lands belongs to these particular numbers. The shape carries over.

**This is not the registered `H*`.** That number comes from a complete `|A|^H`
enumeration over a declared action set on the two-node coupled cue tree, with the
epistemic term restricted to the context node (`Δε = 1.72` nats at `H = 1`), and it
carries a completeness certificate. Here two named plans are scored on a flat
four-dimensional chain with a whole-state epistemic term (`Δε = 6.67` nats), and nothing
is searched. The two land on the same integer. Nothing follows from that.

`--check` asserts what the figures claim and prints it, with no plotting deps.
Everything asserted is open-loop, so none of it takes a seed. The animated runs take
one, named in the caption::
