"""Anti-surge margin on a compressor, where the flow meter's noise is `R(Q)`.

An applied case for state-dependent sensing, based on my reading of GT2024-124905
(doi:10.1115/GT2024-124905). Nothing here is a claim about what that paper did.

A centrifugal compressor must not be run below its surge line, so anti-surge control
holds a margin above it. Flow is measured here with a differential-pressure element,
and a DP element obeys `Q = k·√ΔP` with roughly flat transmitter error. Propagate that
through the square root and the variance of the flow measurement is

    R(Q) = e_ref²·Q_ref⁴ / Q²

The noise on the flow reading depends on the flow being read. Nobody modelled that in.
It is what a DP meter does, and it is why such a meter has a turndown limit at all.

The element type sets the sign, and the sign decides the result. A Coriolis or
ultrasonic meter holds roughly a constant percentage of rate, so `R ∝ Q²` and the
epistemic term pushes the other way. A meter with constant absolute error has `R'= 0`
and no epistemic term at all. `docs/guides/surge_margin_derivation.md` carries the
derivation, the sign table and the one calibration constant.

Two agents differ in one line: a fixed-`R` twin frozen at the design operating point,
and an `R(x)` agent given the meter's real noise. The collapse the twin exhibits is a
property of *the agent's generative model*, which is linear-Gaussian with additive
control here, and not of the plant. An EKF linearised on a nonlinear plant has
action-dependent Jacobians and does not collapse this way, whatever its `R` does.

`--check` reports six registered falsifiers plus the sensor probe, with no plotting
deps:

- dissociation: the twin's epistemic term is dead-flat across the valve grid, the
  `R(x)` agent's is not. Koudahl, Kouw and de Vries proved the flat case for
  fixed-noise linear Gaussian state space models (Entropy 23(12):1565, 2021,
  doi:10.3390/e23121565); ADR-003 records it here;
- standoff: the twin's `argmin G` is exactly `argmin pragmatic`, so its operating point
  is whatever preference dictates and nothing else. The `R(x)` agent's sits further
  from surge, held off by the ambiguity term;
- meter quality: over an 8:1 turndown ladder the `R(x)` standoff moves monotonically
  while the twin's does not move at all. The surge control line is an inference outcome
  under `R(Q)` and a hand-set constant under fixed `R`;
- slope: `ℓ'(m) = d/dm log R` from autodiff matches the closed form `−2/Q`, so this
  sensor's inference-gap coefficient is `c₂ = (ℓ'/2)² = 1/Q²`;
- robustness: the `R(x)` agent stays held off the twin's standoff across a 10:1 sweep
  of the economic weight `Λ`, so the *direction* of the offset survives that knob.

**Where the standoff sits is a `Λ` artefact and is not a result.** `Λ` prices margin
against information and I chose it. Sweeping it 10:1 moves the standoff by more than
the meter ladder does, which `--check` prints beside the ladder so the two cannot be
read as comparable. The existence of the offset and its direction are what survive.

**The direction is not the engineering one, and that is the interesting part.** A worse
meter moves this agent *closer* to surge, because a meter that resolves nothing offers
no information to go and get, so the economic term wins. Real surge margin is set by the
cost of being wrong, which is a pragmatic quantity. The ambiguity term is not a safety
factor, and this demo is the cleanest way to see that it is not.

The bare command renders a three-panel figure:

- LEFT and MIDDLE: EFE and its split across the valve grid, one agent each at a shared
  y-scale, surge line marked. The twin's flat epistemic line against the `R(x)`
  agent's rising one, and the `G` argmin moving off the pragmatic argmin.
- RIGHT: standoff against meter turndown. A flat line (fixed `R`) against a curve. The
  vertical position of that curve is set by `Λ`, so read its shape and not its height.

Nothing here is a citable number. See `examples/README.md`.
