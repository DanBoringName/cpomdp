"""Figure: the epistemic collapse breaks from the *inside* — through process noise.

The companion to examples/efe_collapse_figure.py. There, a state-dependent sensor
R(x) made the epistemic term action-dependent. Here the observation noise R is held
FIXED and the action-dependence comes entirely from state-dependent internal
process noise Q(x) — the route RFC-001 chapter 8 cares about, where the binding
precision constraint lives in internal processing rather than the sensor.

- LEFT (fixed Q): epistemic is flat across actions — the ADR-003 collapse, same as
  a fixed sensor. R and Q are both constant, so Σ⁺, S, and the info gain do not
  move with the action.
- RIGHT (state-dependent Q(x)): epistemic curves. Q is evaluated at μ⁺ (the
  arrived-at state), so it depends on the action; Σ⁺ = AΣAᵀ + Q(μ⁺) and the info
  gain move with it. R is the SAME constant as on the left — the whole effect is
  internal.
