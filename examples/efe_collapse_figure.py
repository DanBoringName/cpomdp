"""The single-chain EFE epistemic collapse, and how a state-dependent sensor breaks it.

This is the model class of the paper's section 3.1 made executable: one node, no
couplings, additive control, and a sensor whose noise `R(x)` depends on the state — run
through the flat `KalmanBackend(CallableSensor)` route (the coupling-free `R(x)` case
the `CouplingGraphBackend.to_flat_model` docstring points at: build the Kalman model
with a `CallableSensor` directly rather than flattening a graph). The T-maze demo
illustrates the same mechanism on a richer branching graph; here it is the theorem's
own chain.

`--check` asserts Theorem 1's clauses (i) and (iii) on this class, plus the pinning
Lemma 1 rests on, with no plotting deps:

- (i)   the posterior covariance and the Kalman gain *move with the action* — the dual
        effect, the control reaching a covariance rather than only a mean;
- (iii) the one-step epistemic value *varies* across a candidate-action grid;
- twin  freezing `R` at the predicted mean `μ⁻` makes that same term dead-flat —
        ADR-003's collapse: a fixed linear-Gaussian sensor reduces EFE to LQR;
- pin   `R(μ⁻(a))` — the noise the sensor presents at the predicted mean — traces a
        curve across the grid. No horizontal line follows a curve, which is the
        pinning argument drawn: a fixed noise schedule is named in advance and cannot
        track it.

The bare command renders the two-panel figure that plots the same sweep:

- LEFT (fixed sensor): the epistemic term is dead-flat across actions, so `G`'s minimum
  is driven entirely by the pragmatic term — `argmin G == argmin pragmatic`.
- RIGHT (state-dependent sensor): a "precision well" makes the sensor sharp near a
  beacon away from the goal. The epistemic term *curves* (peaks at the beacon) and
  `G`'s minimum is pulled off the goal toward information — the detour.

The right-hand sensor is a real `CallableSensor` supplying a position-dependent
`R(x)` to `expected_free_energy` through the `gaussianize` seam.
