"""The E. coli chemotaxis network as a native FFG — built *with* cpomdp (issue #32).

A receptor-driven CheA hub feeds a fast CheY -> motor branch and a slow CheR/CheB
methylation branch. Each node is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process discretised on a single
clock via ``GaussianTransition.from_ou`` (ADR-017); the structural couplings are the
within-slice signal transduction ``child = W * parent + noise``. Topology matches the
RxInfer oracle ``cpomdp_chemotaxis_tree``.

This is a model built on the toolbox, not part of it: the Phase-3 acceptance tests and
the end-to-end demo (#27) import ``chemotaxis_ffg`` from here.
