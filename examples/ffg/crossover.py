"""Where the crossover lives: the horizon at which the best plan stops reaching.

At a short horizon the best plan on the coupled-tree cue task is a direct reach for the
goal. At a long enough horizon it becomes a two-phase walk: drive to the cue, sense the
hidden context, reverse, and commit. This demo locates the horizon H* where the switch
happens and shows why.

Two measurements, and the distinction between them is the whole point.

- **The decisive one is selection-free.** For each horizon the *exhaustive* argmin over
  every ``A^H`` action sequence is computed by ``EnumeratedEfeSearch.over_backend``. It
  is prior-ward (a reach) through H = 6 and cue-ward (a two-phase walk) at H = 7, and
  each horizon is an exact finite enumeration, so no policy is chosen with knowledge of
  the outcome. This is what carries the result.

- **The mechanism curve is exposition, and it is post-selection.** The specific walk the
  search picks out at H = 7, ``[+1,-2,-2,0,...]``, is scored back across the horizon
  against the coast-to-stop reach ``[-2,-1,0,...]`` to read out the epistemic and
  pragmatic split. That pair was *found by* the search, so its crossing is shown to
  explain the flip, never to establish it.

The mechanism is the surprising part. The epistemic pull is flat (~1.7 nats, the
one-step value); it does not accumulate. What moves is the pragmatic gradient: after
sensing at the cue the contracted context belief lowers the *commit* channel's expected
ambiguity by ~0.67 nats per step, and that saving accumulates until it overtakes the
one-time detour cost. So the reach's advantage decays with the horizon and the walk wins
at H = 7 -- the gradient decays below the constant pull, not the pull past the gradient.

``--check`` asserts the flip, the mechanism split, an independent NumPy oracle on the
headline number, and the kernel's numerical inertness, with no plotting deps.
``--refinement`` re-runs the registered refinement cells on the chunked path, which is
minutes to hours and so sits off every gate::

    uv run --no-sync python examples/ffg/crossover.py --check

    it is evidence for nothing and is not a survivor. ``NOT RUN HERE`` was measured
    elsewhere. Row 3 is the only one that produced no evidence: it is void by
    construction, with no observation draw to vary, so its prover cell is ``—`` because
    attributing one would claim evidence that was never produced. No row returns
    ``NOT RUN HERE`` any more.

    Rows 1, 2, 4 and 5 read on both axes at once. On the prover axis they are

    allows on a difference of two scores.

    comes from ``cue_ward``, off the exhaustive argmin, so a reversed result reports
    ``FIRED`` instead of printing the old sentence beside a cleared magnitude test. A
