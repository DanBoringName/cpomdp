"""The cue maze, in as many spatial dimensions as you ask for.

A hidden context decides which of two goals pays. The agent's prior points at the wrong
one. A cue somewhere else in the arena reads the context sharply. The reading only
works while the agent is standing on it, so learning the truth costs a detour away from
where the agent currently believes the payoff is.

None of that is one-dimensional. This module builds it for any `n_dims >= 1`:

- **1-D** is the corridor the crossover result was measured on. Both goals and the cue
  sit on one axis, so the detour is a there-and-back walk.
- **2-D** puts the cue *perpendicular* to the line between the goals. The detour becomes
  a shape rather than a reversal, and a multi-step plan is legible on screen.
- **3-D and up** work the same way and are built the same way. Whether they are
  *affordable* is a separate question, and `enumeration_cost` answers it before you
  commit to a sweep.

The graph is one rooted tree in every dimension. Node 0 is the hidden context, a scalar.
Node 1 is the arena: the agent's position followed by its belief about where the
paying goal is. A coupling drives the goal belief from the context, and a sensor on
node 1 reads displacement, so the context is only ever seen through the coupling.

Nothing here is cpomdp API. It is a model built *with* cpomdp, in the same spirit as
`chemotaxis_model.py`. `tests/test_horizon_dimensions.py` builds its arena from it; no
demo does yet.
