"""Why the constant-action family cannot express the detour-then-exploit crossover.

The interesting multi-step behaviour on the coupled-tree cue task is a *two-phase*
sequence: drive to the cue, sense the hidden context, then commit to the arm the cue
revealed. That policy varies across the horizon. The constant-action family holds one
action for the whole horizon, so a constant "walk" toward the cue *overshoots* it — the
agent senses at the first step and then moves straight past, so the information is
acquired once and never exploited.

This sweep makes that concrete. It runs the crossover statistic for the constant
reach/walk pair over the horizon and shows two things:

- the **epistemic pull plateaus** instead of accumulating — a flat Δε is the fingerprint
  of information acquired once and wasted;
- the **pragmatic gradient never yields**, so ΔG stays positive and the reach wins at
  every horizon — there is no crossover.

That null is a *search-family artefact*, not a property of the objective. It is the
concrete reason the exhaustive varying-sequence search (``EnumeratedEfeSearch``) is
necessary rather than optional: the crossover horizon lives there, where the best policy
is free to become a two-phase walk. Read this demo as the motivation for that search.

``--check`` asserts the null with no plotting deps; the bare command prints the table::

    uv run --no-sync python examples/ffg/crossover_sweep.py --check
    uv run --no-sync python examples/ffg/crossover_sweep.py
